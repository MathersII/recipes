Ingredients:

 - 2 eggs
 - half a cup of milk (doesn't matter which type)
 - two slices of bread
 - two slices of ham or bologna (if not vegetarian)
 - two slices of cheese (preferably one that melts)
 - butter, salt and pepper.

Directions:

 1. Crack the eggs and whisk them with half a cup of your preffered milk
    and add salt and pepper to taste.

 2. Soak the bread into this mix for around 3 min or until the bread is 
    soggy, but not fragile.

 3. In a non-stick pan big enough for the bread to fit and tall enough 
    for all ingredients to be in, drop half the butter and put the first 
    slice of bread, once it is golden brown on one side, flip it over.
 
 4. Once the other side is golden, take it out and repeat the last step 
    with the other one until one side is golden brown.

 5. Once flipped stack as following: Bread, Meat, Cheese, Bread, Meat 
    Cheese.

 6. Once stacked, pour the rest of the egg-milk mix, cover and let on 
    low heat for around 10 mins.

 7. If whisked properly, the mix should fluff. Plate and serve with 
    coffee, any fruit juice or chocolate milk. Enjoy.
